# PlotSense

**PlotSense** is an AI-powered Python package that provides intelligent data visualization suggestions. It helps data professionals automate the process of selecting the best visualizations based on data type, relationships, and user goals, making data exploration more efficient, insightful, and accessible.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Visualization Suggestions**: Automatically recommends the best visualizations based on data properties (e.g., numerical, categorical, correlations).
- **Explainability**: Explains why a specific visualization was chosen, helping users understand the rationale behind the suggestion.
- **Customization**: Allows users to customize visualizations by adjusting colors, labels, and more.

## Installation

To install PlotSense, use pip:

```bash
pip install plotsense
import plotsense as ps
```
## Example 1: AI-Powered Visualisation Suggestions
```bash
# Load your dataset (e.g., pandas DataFrame)
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('your-dataset.csv')

# Get AI-powered visualization suggestions
suggestions = ps.suggest_visualizations(df)

# Create Plots
plot1 = ps.plot(df)
plot2 = ps.plot(df['x','y'])

# Get explanation for the suggested visualization
explain_plot1 = ps.explain(plot1)
explain_plot2 = ps.explain(plot2)

print(explain_plot1)

```
